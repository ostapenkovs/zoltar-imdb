App creates a deep learning model with embedding, global average pooling 1D, and dense layers. The model is trained and predicts on a dataset of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews for sentiment analysis purposes. The model discerns between a positive and a negative movie review with considerable accuracy.

Predictions in the front end are styled after Zoltar Speaks, the fortune teller arcade game.
